# Bank Loan Report Project
Overview:
The Bank Loan Report project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of key loan-related metrics and trends to monitor and assess our bank's lending activities and performance. The report will facilitate data-driven decision-making, track the loan portfolio's health, and identify trends to inform lending strategies.

SQL Queries:
The project involves the use of SQL queries to extract, transform, and analyze data related to bank loan activities. The SQL queries cover a wide range of key performance indicators (KPIs) and loan status metrics, including total loan applications, funded amounts, amount received, average interest rates, and loan categorization into 'Good Loans' and 'Bad Loans'.

Data Cleaning:
The project also involves data cleaning tasks to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis. This includes handling missing data, removing duplicates, and converting data types to ensure consistency and integrity.

Tableau Visualizations:
The project includes Tableau visualizations to provide a visual representation of the critical loan-related metrics and trends. The Tableau visualizations offer an interactive and insightful view of the lending operations, facilitating data-driven decision-making and enabling valuable insights into various loan parameters.
